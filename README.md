# F1 Spots

A community platform for F1 enthusiasts to save and share their favorite spots - whether it's watching locations, meetup places, or anything F1-related.

## About

If you don't F1, that's okay. But if you do, wouldn't it be great to save your favorite F1 spots for later or share them with the community (or keep them private in personal groups)?

This project aims to create a safe, community-driven platform where F1 fans can:

- Save and organize their favorite F1-related locations
- Share spots with the community or keep them private
- Discover new places through trusted community members
- Connect with fellow F1 enthusiasts

## Project Status

Currently developing the **website** version. Once we reach our milestone of saved spots (tracked on the stats page), we'll develop a mobile application - likely for **Android first**.

### Stats Page

The platform includes a public statistics page showing:

- Total number of spots saved (both private and public)
- Community growth metrics
- *Note: Only aggregate numbers are displayed to respect privacy*

## Access & Privacy

### Account Approval Required

To maintain a quality community and protect our favorite spots from overcrowding or misuse:

- New accounts require admin approval
- Instagram handle required for verification during signup
- This helps ensure the community stays respectful and trustworthy

### Privacy Levels

Users can control the visibility of their saved spots:

- **Private**: Only you can see
- **Group**: Share with selected friends/groups
- **Public**: Share with the entire community

## Philosophy

We don't want problems, and we don't want to expose cool places to people who might bring trouble. Let's F1 and relax.
