if you dont f1 tha'ts okay. But if you do, what about saving the place to f1 to later or share with community(or personal groups only).

I will create a website, if it works i will create application too.

To work your account needs to be accepted by admin, I will require your instagram at first to check if your are ok or not to be there.

Maybe something also as privacy level

Dont want problem, and dont want to expose cool places to people to bring trouble, lets f1 and relax.
