# F1+ Spots - Next Features

## Priority 1: Map Interaction Improvements

### Container beside map (NOT touching map)
- Add a sidebar/panel next to the map (not overlay)
- All controls and forms in this container
- Map stays full interactive on the other side

### Better spot creation with 3 options:
1. **Click to add** (MOST IMPORTANT - NOT WORKING YET)
   - User clicks "Add Spot" button
   - Then clicks anywhere on map to place it
   - One click = spot created at that point

2. **Draggable pin with precision radius**
   - Show a circle around the pin
   - User can adjust radius to set precision
   - Bigger circle = less precise, smaller = more precise
   - User confirms with button/key press

3. **Current drag method** (keep as option)
   - Drag pin to position
   - Set location manually

## Priority 2: Images on Posts

### Database changes needed:
- Add image upload field to spots table
- Store image URLs or paths
- Support multiple images per spot

### Frontend:
- Image upload component
- Image preview
- Gallery view for spots with multiple images

### Backend:
- File upload endpoint
- Image storage (local or cloud like S3/Cloudinary)
- Image compression/optimization

## Notes:
- Focus on click-to-add first (most important)
- Precision radius circle is key for user experience
- Map container should be separate from controls (no overlay on map)
